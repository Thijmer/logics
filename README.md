# logics
Online client-side node editor

Logics is a program that lets you visualize mathematical formulas by building as a node network. It is inspired on Blender's material nodes.

Nodes make up a network and are resembled as squares with a UI in them. They are connected using wires that transmit data.
Nodes perform an operation to the data, such as addition or converting a number to binary.
The data comes in on the left side of the node and comes out on the right side.
Zooming in and out and moving the viewport is also possible, allowing for networks much larger than your screen!
